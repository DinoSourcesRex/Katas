# CustomerManagement
An exercise given to me, basic get and upsert. Featuring NUnit, Specflow (with in-memory database tests) and Rhinomocks.

#### Restoring
> `Update-Package -reinstall`

If you have any issues with the NuGet restore run `Update-Package -reinstall` from the Package Manager Console to re-path the hintpaths in the .csproj files.

The scripts from the database project will also be xcopied to `C:\Temp\CustomerManagement.Database\Scripts`. This is so that ncrunch can pick them up when running the in-memory tests.

A dacpac will be built to the subfolder `CustomerManagement\dacpac`

#### Live Db tests
This project features a live db test. The test project requires a connection string in the `DatabaseSetup` class. Should probably pull this into the `.config` class come to think of it!

A dacpac will be built to the subfolder `CustomerManagement\dacpac`. CSV files, which are used to seed the db, will be pulled to `C:\Temp\CustomerManagement.Database\Scripts`. This will occur as a post-build event on the Database project.

## Criteria

X Company require a web based user interface to manage prospective and existing customer records, containing information on particular characteristics and preferences captured from various sources. The solution must be quick, responsive, and reliable. 

This is an application for internal use and as such there are no specific design requirements, the clientâ€™s priority is that it is functional.

### Deliverables
*	The database should be seeded with an existing dataset, which will be provided in CSV format
*	The following screens are required
*	Dashboard containing list of customers
*	Update form
*	Insert form

#### Dashboard
The default screen will contain a table containing the latest 20 customers ordered by most recent. The table should contain the following columns

| Date Active     |    dd/mm/yyyy  | The date the customer was last active |
| Is Palindrome   |    Yes / No    | - Value displayed in green if yes, red if no. - Yes or No depending on whether the full name is spelt the same forwards as it is backwards. - The match should not take spaces into account and should also be case insensitive. |
| Favourite Colours | Comma separated list | |

The dashboard will also require a link to insert new records
